# Universal Timestamp Update Solution

## Problem

When scraper jobs (Oban jobs) run and successfully process venues and events, the `last_seen_at` timestamp in the `event_sources` table needs to be reliably updated. Previously, there were cases where the job would succeed but the timestamp wouldn't update, leading to inconsistent data.

The specific issue was:
- The job reported success in the Oban metadata
- The event was successfully processed
- But the `last_seen_at` timestamp wasn't updated in the `event_sources` table
- This happened especially when no actual data changes were made to the event

## Solution

We have implemented a universal solution that ensures the `last_seen_at` timestamp is always updated when a scraper job succeeds, regardless of whether any event data has changed.

### Key Components:

1. **Centralized Timestamp Update Function**
   - Created `JobMetadata.ensure_event_source_timestamp/3` which:
     - Takes an event_id, source_id, and optional source_url
     - Updates the `last_seen_at` timestamp to the current time
     - Handles error cases and logs appropriate messages
     - Works within a transaction to ensure atomicity

2. **Integration with Job Metadata System**
   - Modified `JobMetadata.update_detail_job/4` to:
     - Extract event_id and source_id from the result
     - Call the timestamp update function when a job succeeds
     - Include source_id in the metadata for all scrapers

3. **Consistent Source ID Handling**
   - Updated all scraper jobs (QuizmeistersDetailJob, QuestionOneDetailJob, etc.) to:
     - Include source_id in their metadata updates
     - Pass source_id as an option to the metadata update functions

4. **Robust Error Handling and Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging at each stage:
     - Before timestamp update attempts
     - After successful updates
     - For any errors encountered
   - Transaction-based updates to prevent partial success

5. **URL Normalization**
   - Added source URL normalization for consistent lookup

## How It Works

When a scraper job processes a venue and event:

1. The job performs its normal processing
2. When reporting success via `JobMetadata.update_detail_job`:
   - The system extracts the event_id and source_id
   - It calls `ensure_event_source_timestamp`
   - The timestamp is updated in a transaction
3. The `last_seen_at` field is updated even if no other data changed

## Testing

A test script is available at `lib/debug/test_timestamp_update_mechanism.exs` which verifies:
- Direct function calls to `ensure_event_source_timestamp`
- Integration with the job metadata system
- A full end-to-end test with a real venue (Bridie O'Reilly's Chapel St)

Run the test with:
```bash
mix run lib/debug/test_timestamp_update_mechanism.exs
```

## Benefits

This solution:
- Creates a **single point of responsibility** for timestamp updates
- Works across **all scrapers** uniformly
- Is **resilient to failures** with proper error handling
- **Always updates** timestamps on success, regardless of data changes
- Provides **detailed logging** for troubleshooting

## Future Considerations

- Add more comprehensive tests in the test suite
- Consider monitoring timestamp update failures
- Potentially add a "last_attempted_at" field to track scrape attempts even in failure cases
