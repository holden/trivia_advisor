‚úÖ SUCCESS: force_refresh=true caused the file to be re-downloaded (timestamps differ)

Now let's check what happens in the Oban job context...

======= Inserting QuizmeistersIndexJob with force_refresh_images=true =======
Job inserted with ID: 27655
Check the logs for 'force_refresh: false' messages despite sending 'force_refresh_images: true'
This will confirm if the flag is correctly propagated to the image downloaders

========= TEST COMPLETED =========
If you saw direct calls work with force_refresh=true but the
logs from the Oban job showed force_refresh=false, then there's
a flag propagation issue between the job and the image downloader.
